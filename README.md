# The_Opportunist
Web Development Project(Associated with PDPU)

This a website I made as a project for Web Development course in my fifth semester. The main purpose of the website is to help one find the jobs according to different criteria like location, skills, job title, etc. and also help companies to post job on the website. To begin with the website, please open the file "Home.html" which is the homepage for my website. From there, one can easily explore and navigate to other parts of the website. Also, for storing and retriving the data, I used MySQL database.
